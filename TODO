Propensity headache
===================
What happens with propensities of reactions that have the same educts
but different products?

system Ia, e.g. ketone synthesis
--------------------------------
A + B --> AB == BA

system Ib, e.g. ester synthesis
-------------------------------
A + B --> AB
A + B --> BA

Both systems should have indistinguishable kinetics if they have the
same kinetic rates. Also, total reactivity should only depend on
concentrations/copy numbers, and should not change if monomers differ.


system IIa
----------
AB --> A + B

system IIb
----------
ABC --> A + BC
ABC --> AB + C

Systems IIa and IIb should have different propensities: the likelihood
for a bond to break depends on the number of bonds.
