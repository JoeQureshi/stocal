- infer ReactionRule.order from novel_reactions interface
- python3 compatibility
- statistical verification tests
- volume awareness
- string rewrite rule support
- every/until filters and other stop criteria
= version 1.0.2
- non-autonomous transitions
- curried reactions (determine products only upon application)
- other kinetic laws, e.g. Hill function
- SSA profiling and algorithm variations
- C/C++/D implementation
- libSBML integration

Planned backward incompatible changes:
--------------------------------------
- replace state.get(s, 0) by state[s] in MassAction.reactions
- use multiset unions in ReactionRule.infer_transitions
- replace bad variable names that stocal warns about
